# Sed Stumpwmrc (config file for stumpwm window manager)

# What?

A full screen window manager setup that gets out of your way.

# Screenshots

Well, just imagine your favorite application in fullscreen mode!

# Why?

I just cannot work in an envorinment like Windows, MacOS or even Gnome3. They are all distracting and it's very painful to switch between to applications. Also, I hate the mouse.

# How?

Once I log in to my computer I see a welcome message. That's when I know it's ready to accept my commands. There is nothing else to distract me!

Everything is in full screen. 29" of realstate for every app! No dual-monitor. No tiling. KISS... keep it super simple!

If I want to open firefox I press <kbd>F9</kbd> and then <kbd>f</kbd>. 

Lets start a terminal window... <kbd>F9</kbd> <kbd>t</kbd>

Lets open emacs... <kbd>F9</kbd> <kbd>e</kbd>

Now I want to go back to firefox... <kbd>F9</kbd> <kbd>f</kbd>

I can also press <kbd>F8</kbd> to switch between last 2 windows (emacs & firefox)...

<kbd>F8</kbd> ... and I'm back at my emacs window...

Neat ha? 

There is no numbers... tags... or anything to remember. Too bad this will never work on mac... everything starts with an i... :)

So if you are interested in the way sed-stumpwmrc works just grab the source code, read thourgh it (it's very short) you will need to alter it a bit... then through it at your stumpwm.

If you do not know what stumpwm is... it's basically a very hackable window manager written in Common Lisp.
